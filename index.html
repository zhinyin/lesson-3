    <h1>Is this making sense?</h1>
    <p>This will serve as a little exercise to see how well all this stuff is clicking, in addition to getting you comfortable with some more advanced styling techniques. This is a screenshot of a site.</p>

    

  <div class="project">
    <h1>1.Some boxs in a row.</h1>
	<p>Here's a bunch of boxes floated to each other with letters in the middle, but two of them are special.
      <div>B</div>
      <div id="special">L</div>
      <div>O</div>
	  <div>C</div>
	  <div id="special">K</div>
	  <div>S</div>

  <div class="project">
    <h1>2.This is a photo of a cat.</h1>
	<p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like width: 100%;. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like font-family: monospace;.
</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h1>3.This is a big link.</h1>
	<p> When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.
	<a href="http://www.google.com"><div id="link">Take me to Google</div></a></p>
